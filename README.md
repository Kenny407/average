# Average
> Average is an experiment into masking our browsing activity online.

There are already a variety of tools on the web to block third-party cookies and scripts, and upgrade your connection to HTTPS. However, it is also possible to [fingerprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint) a user, by collecting information from/about their device and using that as a means to identify them. 

The end-goal of this project is to build a browser extension across all browsers that will be able to "fuzz" your fingerprint, making you seem like the average user to whoever is trying to build your fingerprint.
